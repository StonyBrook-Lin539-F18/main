# Morphological paradigms

A morphological paradigm lists related forms of the same words.
For example, the adjectival gradation paradigm of *good* is *good* - *better* - *best*.
The inflectional paradigm of English *like* in the present tense is

Person | Singular form | Plural form
--:    | :--           | :--
1      | like          | like
2      | like          | like
3      | likes         | like

German *mögen*, on the other hand, looks as follows:

Person | Singular form | Plural form
--:    | :--           | :--
1      | mag           | mögen
2      | magst         | mögt
3      | mag           | mögen

You might think that paradigms can take any form you want.
But that does not seem to be the case, some patterns simply do not arise.
There are certain principled gaps in the linguistic typology, like the holes in a Swiss cheese.
The Swiss-cheese nature of language suggests that a substantive universal is at play.

## The $^*$ABA generalization

Adjectives usually come in three degrees:

1. a *positive* form, e.g. *good* or *hard*
1. a *comparative* form, e.g. *better* or *harder*
1. a *superlative* form, e.g. *best* or *hardest*

The contrast between *good* and *hard* already shows that these three forms are not always built the same way.
In *good*-*better*-*best*, the comparative and superlative look very similar, but they are both different from the positive.
We might call this an ABB pattern.
In *hard*-*harder*-*hardest*, all three forms are very similar.
That's an AAA pattern.

Additional patterns can be found in other languages.
The Latin counterpart to *good*-*better*-*best* is *bonus*-*melior*-*optimus*.
Here all three forms are distinct, which is why this is called an ABC pattern.

Curiously absent is anything like *good*-*better*-*goodest*, which would be an ABA pattern.
The curious absence of such ABA patterns across all known languages is known as the *$^*$ABA generalization*. 

The ban against ABA patterns can also be found in pronoun paradigms.
If we ignore number, English has a separate pronoun form for each person.
First person is *I*, second person is *you*, and third person is *he*/*she*/*it*.
This is an ABC pattern.
But looking across languages, we also find languages with AAA, AAB, and ABB.
Only ABA is again curiously absent.

The absence of ABA patterns is an intriguing puzzle, and it can be given a very natural mathematical explanation.

## $^*$ABA as a No-Crossing constraint

Some linguists have argued for a person hierarchy of the form $1 < 2 < 3$.
This means that first person is somehow more prominent or important than second person, which in turn is more important than third person.
There's several linguistic reasons for positing such a hierarchy, but for our purposes a loose analogy is sufficient: people in general care most about themselves and their peers (*we*), then the people they interact with (*you*), and everybody else is at best irrelevant and at worst an enemy (*they*).

If this hierarchy is indeed a substantive universal of natural languages, then a simple mathematical idea is sufficient to explain why pronoun systems can be of the form AAA, AAB, ABB, and ABC, but not ABA.
But let's start with the intuition, first.
Suppose that we line up 1, 2, 3, for person as below, with A, B, C underneath it.

\input_mid{./123_lineup.tikz}

Using this visual format, we can represent an ABC pattern by connecting each person to the form below it.

\input_mid{./123_ABC.tikz}

By contrast, the AAA pattern is the result of linking each person to A.

\input_mid{./123_AAA.tikz}

\begin{exercise}
What patterns do the two pictures below represent?
\end{exercise}

\input_mid{./123_AAB.tikz}

\input_mid{./123_ABB.tikz}

Now contrast the figures above against the one below, which displays an ABA pattern:

\input_mid{./123_ABA.tikz}

The ABA pattern is different from the others because the lines cross at some point.
Linguists have noticed over the years that language in general does not like crossing lines.
For instance, there is a theory known as *Autosegmental phonology*, which serves as the inspiration for the TSL class of $n$-gram grammars.
In this theory, a sound in a word can occupy a position in the word as well as on a specific tier.
This connection can be made explicit with an association line.
But association lines are never allowed to cross.
So at least for pronoun paradigms, the $^*$ABA generalization might just be an instance of a general ban against crossing lines.

What is really interesting is that this ban corresponds to a very natural mathematical property...

## Monotonicity

The figures above can be regarded as functions from $\setof{1,2,3}$ to $\setof{A, B, C}$.
For example, the AAB pattern corresponds to a function $f_{AAB}$ such that

- $1 \mapsto A$,
- $2 \mapsto A$,
- $3 \mapsto B$.

\begin{exercise}
Define
$f_{AAA}$,
$f_{ABB}$,
$f_{ABC}$,
and
$f_{ABA}$.
\end{exercise}

But this is a bit too simplistic.
In the pictures above, the elements of $\setof{1,2,3}$ and $\setof{A,B,C}$ are put in a left-to-right order.
So we aren't just dealing with sets, but with sets that have an order defined over them.
What differentiates $f_{ABA}$ from the others is that it does not respect this order.
It is the only function that is not **monotonic**.

\begin{definition}
Let $f: S \rightarrow T$ be a function from $S$ to $T$.
Assume that $\leq_S$ is an ordering of elements of $S$, whereas $\leq_T$ is an ordering of the elements of $T$.
Then $f$ is **monotonic** iff $x \leq_S y$ implies $f(x) \leq_T f(y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
The function $f_{AAB}$ is monotonic because

<ul>
<li>$1 \leq_S 2$ and $f(1) = A \leq_T A = f(2)$</li>
<li>$2 \leq_S 3$ and $f(2) = A \leq_T B = f(3)$</li>
<li>$1 \leq_S 3$ and $f(1) = A \leq_T B = f(3)$</li>
</ul>
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Show that $f_{ABA}$ is not monotonic.
\end{exercise}

One can show that no matter how one orders A, B, and C, no monotonic function can produce an ABA pattern as long as the hierarchy for person is $1 < 2 < 3$.
So the $^*$ABA generalization for pronouns follows from two substantive universals:

1. All languages use a person hierarchy $1 < 2 < 3$.
1. For every morphological paradigm, the mapping from the underlying hierarchy to the output forms must be monotonic.

\begin{exercise}
Show that monotonicity also explains the absence of adjectival gradation paradigms like *good*-*better*-*goodest* if one assumes the hierarchy $\text{positive} < \text{comparative} < \text{superlative}$.
Explain why this is an intuitively plausible hierarchy.
\end{exercise}

You might wonder why we restated the No-Crossing constraint in terms of the mathematical property of monotonicity.
Doesn't the former get the job done just as well?
In the case at hand, certainly.
But monotonicity is a more abstract property, and as we will see in the next two notebooks, this abstractness allows it to be easily generalized to a number of phenomena which the No-Crossing constraint has little to say about.
