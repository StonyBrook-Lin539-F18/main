# Strings: Basic notation

Strings play a very prominent role in computational linguistics.
Mathematically, they can be regarded as tuples or a particular kind of function --- see the interdefinability section in the background material for details (once it has been unlocked).
Intuitively, a string is a sequence of symbols, like $\mathit{nfm}$, *wendigo*, or *105ยง/*.
In contrast to sets, strings are ordered and can contain duplicates.

\begin{example}
The sets $\setof{m,a,d}$, $\setof{d,a,m}$, and $\setof{a,d,a,m}$  are equivalent, but for strings $\mathit{mad} \neq \mathit{dam} \neq \mathit{adam}$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Fill in $=$ or $\neq$ as appropriate for each pair of strings below.
<ol>
<li>$\mathit{abba}$ \_ $\mathit{ABBA}$</li>
<li>$10$ \_ $5 + 5$</li>
<li>$\setof{m,a,d} \_ \setof{d,a,m}$</li>
</ol>

Caution: all of these are strings over a suitable alphabet!
\end{exercise}

## Alphabet

When talking about strings, one usually fixes a finite set of symbols over which the strings are built.
This is called an **alphabet**.
Alphabets are often given labels like $\Sigma$ or $\Omega$.
A string over alphabet $\Sigma$ is also called a $\Sigma$-string.

\begin{example}
The set of Latin characters (A-Z, a-z) is an alphabet that's familiar to all of you.
Strings over it include:

<ul>
<li>
string
</li>
<li>
alphabet
</li>
<li>
aaaaaaa
</li>
<li>
c
</li>
</ul>
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The set of Arabic digits is an alphabet with symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Every natural number, when represented in decimal as usual, is a string over this alphabet.
But not every string over this alphabet is a number of the decimal system.
For instance, 000134095 is not a valid number, although 134095 is.
\end{example}

## String length

The length of a $\Sigma$-string $s$ is indicated by $\length{s}$.
For instance,
$\length{\text{ant}} = 3$,
$\length{0770001} = 7$,
and $\length{\text{a}} = 1$.

The set of all strings over $\Sigma$ whose length is exactly $n$ is denoted by $\Sigma^n$.

\begin{example}
Let $\Sigma \is \setof{a,b}$.
Then $\Sigma^3$ contains all of the following strings, and only those:

<ol>
<li>$aaa$,</li>
<li>$aab$,</li>
<li>$aba$,</li>
<li>$abb$,</li>
<li>$baa$,</li>
<li>$bab$,</li>
<li>$bba$,</li>
<li>$bbb$,</li>
</ol>
\end{example}

The size of $\Sigma^n$ is always fixed.
If $\Sigma$ has $m$ members, then $\Sigma^n$ contains $m^n$ strings.

\begin{example}
In the previous example, $\Sigma$ contains two symbols, so $\Sigma^n$ should consist of $2^3 = 8$ distinct strings.
That's exactly what we found.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Which one of the following are members of $\setof{a,b}^4$?
<ol>
<li>$\mathit{aaab}$</li>
<li>$\mathit{aba}$</li>
<li>$\mathit{aaaaa}$</li>
<li>$\mathit{b}$</li>
</ol>
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
List all members of $\setof{k,o,z}^2$.
\end{exercise}

Very often expressions like $a^n$ are used as a shorthand for $\setof{a}^n$.

\begin{example}
The expression $\mathit{b a^5 c^3 d}$ is a shorthand for $\mathit{baaaaacccd}$.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Write each one of the following in a more compact fashion using exponents.

<ol>
<li>ABBA</li>
<li>loool</li>
<li>aardvark</li>
</ol>
\end{exercise}

## Infinite string sets over $\Sigma$

Since alphabets must be finite, $\Sigma^n$ is necessarily finite for any alphabet $\Sigma$ and $n \geq 0$.
But the set of all strings over $\Sigma$ is infinite.

\begin{example}
Let $\Sigma \is \setof{a}$.
Then $a$ is a string over $\Sigma$, and so are $\mathit{aa}$, $\mathit{aaa}$, $\mathit{aaaa}$, and so on.
This enumeration continues indefinitely, so there must be infinitely many distinct strings over $\Sigma$.
\end{example}

Two infinite string sets are commonly defined over $\Sigma$.
They are $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^+$, respectively.
The former contains all strings over $\Sigma$, whereas the latter contains all strings whose length is at least $1$.
The only difference between the two is that $\Sigma^*$ also contain the **empty string** $\emptystring$.
The empty string is the string counterpart of the number 0: it represents nothing.
In fact, $\emptystring$ is the only string whose length is 0.

\begin{example}
Let $\Sigma = \setof{a,b}$.
Then $\Sigma^*$ contains

<ul>
<li>$\emptystring$,</li>
<li>$\mathit{a}$,</li>
<li>$\mathit{b}$,</li>
<li>$\mathit{aa}$,</li>
<li>$\mathit{ab}$,</li>
<li>$\mathit{ba}$,</li>
<li>$\mathit{bb}$,</li>
<li>$\mathit{aaa}$,</li>
<li>$\mathit{aab}$,</li>
<li>$\mathit{aba}$,</li>
<li>$\mathit{abb}$,</li>
<li>and so on.</li>
</ul>

All these strings are also members of $\Sigma^+$, except $\emptystring$.
\end{example}

$\Sigma^*$ is also called the **Kleene closure**, named after [Stephen C. Kleene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene).

Here's a little bit of background to make it easier for you to remember the difference between $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^+$.
As you might know from search engines, the Kleene star `*` is sometimes used as a wildcard that matches everything.
So $\Sigma^*$ can be translated as "every string built over $\Sigma$".
On the other hand $\Sigma^+$ only contains those strings whose length is at least 1, or in other words, whose length is positive.
And $+$ is a common abbreviation for positive (just think of batteries).

\begin{exercise}
Enumerate the five shortest members of $\setof{a}^*$.
\end{exercise}

## Concatenation

Given two $\Sigma$-strings $u$ and $v$, their **concatenation** $u \stringcat v$ is the result of "glueing" the left end of $v$ to the right end of $u$.
Concatenation is associative, so $u \stringcat (v \stringcat w) = (u \stringcat v) \stringcat w$.

\begin{example}
Here are a few examples:

<ol>
<li>$\mathit{math} \stringcat \mathit{ematics} = \mathit{mathematics}$,</li>
<li>$2000 \stringcat 18 = 200018$,</li>
<li>$\text{Thomas} \stringcat \text{Graf} = \text{ThomasGraf}$.</li>
</ol>
\end{example}

Even though concatenation is associative, it is not commutative.
That is to say, $u \stringcat v$ and $v \stringcat u$ are not necessarily the same.

\begin{example}
Let $u \is \text{house}$ and $v \is \text{boat}$.
Then $u \stringcat v$ is *houseboat*, whereas $v \stringcat u$ is *boathouse*.
Those are not the same strings (and they also happen to mean completely different things).
\end{example}

Note the special behavior of the empty string: $u \stringcat \emptystring = \emptystring \stringcat u = u$. 
This makes sense: adding nothing to $u$ does not change $u$, just like adding 0 to a number does not change that number.

Sometimes concatenation is not explicitly indicated, so that instead of $u \stringcat v$ one may simply write $\mathit{uv}$.

\begin{exercise}
Give an example of distinct $u$ and $v$ such that $u \stringcat v = v \stringcat u$ and neither $u$ nor $v$ is the empty string.
\end{exercise}
