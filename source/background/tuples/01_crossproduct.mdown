- Tuples (basics)

# Crossproduct

One often wants to define an entire set of tuples.
This can be done with set-builder notation.

\begin{example}
Let $N$ be a set of names and $P$ a set of phone numbers.
Then we might define an address book as the set
$$
A \is \setof{ \tuple{n, p} \mid n \in N, p \in P, \text{ and } p  \text{ is } n \text{'s phone number}}
$$
\end{example}

But when we want to allow all possible combinations, there is an easier option.
Consider the colored objects depicted below:

\input_mid{./shapes.tikz}

We can represent each object as a pair $\tuple{s,c}$ where $s$ and $c$ are drawn from a set $S \is \setof{\text{square}, \text{circle}}$ of shapes and a set $C \is \setof{\text{blue}, \text{red}}$ of colors, respectively.
The figure above contains every possible combination of shapes and colors.
We can still use set-builder notation in this case: $\setof{ \tuple{s,c} \mid s \in S, c \in C}$.

\begin{exercise}
Why shouldn't we use a set $\setof{s,c}$ instead of the pair $\tuple{s,c}$?
What might go wrong in this case depending on our choice of $S$ and $C$?
\end{exercise}

A more elegant alternative to set-builder notation, however, is the **crossproduct** or **Cartesian product**.

\begin{definition}
For any two sets $S$ and $T$, their crossproduct $S \times C$ is defined as $\setof{ \tuple{s,c} \mid s \in S, c \in C}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
For $S \is \setof{\text{square}, \text{circle}}$ and $C \is \setof{\text{blue}, \text{red}}$, $S \times C$ contains the pairs 

<ol>
<li>$\tuple{\text{square}, \text{blue}}$</li>
<li>$\tuple{\text{circle}, \text{blue}}$</li>
<li>$\tuple{\text{square}, \text{red}}$</li>
<li>$\tuple{\text{circle}, \text{red}}$</li>
</ol>

This is different from $C \times S$, which contains

<ol>
<li>$\tuple{\text{blue}, \text{square}}$</li>
<li>$\tuple{\text{blue}, \text{circle}}$</li>
<li>$\tuple{\text{red}, \text{square}}$</li>
<li>$\tuple{\text{red}, \text{circle}}$</li>
</ol>
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose $S$ consists of **John**, **Mary**, and **the old man**, whereas $V$ contains only *slept* and *left*.
Compute $S \times V$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
In a certain sense, the crossproduct is the result of generalizing concatenation from tuples to sets of 1-tuples.
Explain why.
\end{exercise}

\begin{remark}
The name Cartesian product makes more sense if you consider the special case of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$.
Here $\mathbb{N} \is \setof{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots}$ is the set of all natural numbers.
So $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is the set of all possible pairs of natural numbers.
We can take these two components to represent $(x,y)$-coordinates in the upper right quadrant of a coordinate system.
Such a coordinate system is also called a **Cartesian plane**, and that is why the crossproduct is sometimes called the Cartesian product.
\end{remark}

Just like tuple concatenation, the crossproduct operation is associative but not commutative.
