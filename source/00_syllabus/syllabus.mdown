Course Outline
--------------

### Bulletin Description

An overview of the mathematical foundations of theoretical and computational linguistics.
Topics covered include set theory, morphisms, logic and model theory, algebra, lattices, lambda calculus, probability theory, information theory, and basics of formal language theory.
A strong emphasis is put on the linguistic application of the mathematical concepts in the study and analysis of natural language data.


### Full Description

This course is an introduction to mathematics in linguistics.
It aims to help students familiarize themselves with mathematical concepts and applications that are widely relevant to theoretical and/or computational linguistics.
This covers a wide range of topics, mostly from *discrete mathematics*.
The course is also very different from what you did in high school, there's precious few numbers here and we don't care much about trigonometry or calculating compound interest.
In contrast to a proper mathematics course, we also focus more on techniques and tools rather than theorems and proofs.
This means that you will learn how to work with things like matrices, semirings, and lattices, but you won't have to prove things about them.
So this is more like a CS methods course than a proper math class.

For more information about the content, see the [Selected Topics](#Selected-Topics) section.
You will see that the schedule for this class is very ambitious.
It has to be: this class serves an integral function of our Computational Linguistics MA and must get students to a level where they can take courses and read textbooks on mathematically demanding topics such as machine learning.
This is not your typical graduate-level course, it is a **boot camp**, so be prepared to invest a fair amount of blood, sweat, and tears.


### Mode of Instruction: Hybrid Class

The most important mathematics skill is the ability to learn mathematics on your own, without the help of an instructor.
Whether you're doing computational linguistics in the industry or as an academic, sooner or later you will come across some tool or technique that builds on an area of math you have never encountered before.
It is vital for your future career that you can pick up a textbook or survey paper and teach yourself how this unfamiliar kind of math works.

Unfortunately, math is already a very challenging topic for most people, and learning it without somebody's help seems impossible to many.
In order to teach you how to make the transition from listener to autonomous learner, this course is run as a **hybrid class**.
This means that a lot of the learning takes place outside the class room, with physical meetings serving mostly as an evaluation that your learning process outside the class room was successful.
In the context of this specific class, this will work as follows:

- Each week you are assigned several units from the lecture notes.
- You can discuss the material with each other on the [course repository][gitrepo], using the issue tracker.
- The first half of the class is a *Q&A session* where you present your solutions to the assigned exercises.
  These are **not** lectures.
  I will not present material from square one.
  The assumption is that you have worked through the assigned units and have focused questions on specific points.
  Attendance of Q&A sessions is not mandatory, but highly encouraged.
- The second half of the class is an *exercise session* (more on that below).
  Only the peer graders have to show up for this part, but everybody else is of course welcome to attend.

Expect the workload outside the class room to be much higher than usual, but on the flipside you do not even have to come to class if you have no questions and aren't a peer grader for this week.

The lecture notes will be made available as [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) on a [dedicated server][server] (right now, this server is only accessible through Stony Brook's [Virtual SINC][sinc], but hopefully it will soon be accessible like any other website).
You can also find them in the [course repository][gitrepo].
A Jupyter notebook is a mixture of text and Python code, which allows for a more interactive learning environment.
There are multiple ways you can view the notebooks.
In order of preference:

- Use the [preconfigured Jupyter server that is provided for this class][server].
  If this does not work, make sure you're connecting through [Virtual SINC][sinc].
- Use the department's virtual machine image for VirtualBox, available at Stony Brook's [Softweb](https://softweb.cc.stonybrook.edu/).
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a Python distro that also installs Jupyter.
- If you already have a working Python setup, install Jupyter separately.
- If you can live without the interactive Python demonstrations, pdfs of the notebooks will be shared in the [course repository][gitrepo]

Ideally, you will be using the first option which takes care of all the setup for you.
For all other options, you have to take a few steps of your own.
In particular, you must use the supplied `start_jupyter.py` script to start the Jupyter server, otherwise the notebooks won't be formatted correctly.
Proceed as follows:

1.  Clone or download the [course repository][gitrepo] (green button at the top of the page).
1.  If you downloaded the repository as a zip archive, extract it.
1.  Run the `start_jupyter.py` script.
    The Jupyter notebook server will start and open a new tab in your browser.
1.  Navigate to the notebook you want to read.
    They are all in the notebooks folder.

### Prerequisites

Students are expected to have some previous experience with phonology and syntax at the undergraduate or graduate level.
Students who do not satisfy this requirement should be enrolled in Syntax 1 and either Phonetics or Phonology 1 at the same time.
No prior mathematical or computational experience is required.

Grading
-------

This course can only be taken for 0 or 3 credits.
Student grades are determined by the following components:

1.  **Submitted homeworks (30%)**  
    Each Monday students are assigned a number of exercises from the notebooks.
    Students then have three days to work on them and must submit their solutions to the peer graders before Thursday 11:59pm.
    Performance will be evaluated by the peer graders on a P/F basis.
    F is reserved for homeworks where the student clearly didn't make an effort.

1.  **Peer grading of exercises (30%)**  
    Each week a group of students (usually 2 or 3) collect all student homeworks after the deadline to grade them.
    This breaks down into two phases:
    - From Thursday to Monday, the peer graders look at the homeworks, but do not grade them yet. 
    - On Monday, the peer graders meet with the instructor during the exercise session to discuss their own solutions and any issues they encountered with other students' homeworks.
    - After the meeting, they grade the homeworks and return them to the students by Wednesday, 2pm.
    - Students in turn submit their evaluation of the peer grader's performance via email to the instructor.
      The evaluation is P/F, with F reserved for cases where the grader did not make an effort.

1.  **Final oral exam (30%)**  
    At the end of the semester students take an oral exam in groups of 2 or 3.
    Each student gets a different exercise and must present their solution on the board while the other students ask clarification questions.
    The format loosely resembles that of exercise sessions.
    Performance is evaluated based on the correctness of the solution, the clarity of presentation, and the questions asked during the other student's presentation.

1.  **Taking the initial assessment (10%)**  
    At the beginning of the semester, students are asked to take a survey to assess their mathematical aptitude.
    Participation is worth 10 percentage points.
    It is perfectly alright to fail every single question, the goal is not to weed out "bad" students but to figure out the best way to pair up students for peer grading.
    You can leave the completed survey in my department mailbox (in the copier room), or upload it to [this shared Google drive folder][googlefolder].
    Performance is P/F depending on whether a filled-out survey was submitted (answering "Don't know" on each question is perfectly fine).


Policies
