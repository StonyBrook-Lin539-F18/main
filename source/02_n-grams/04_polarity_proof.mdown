# Proof: Equivalence of positive and negative grammars

This section defines both negative and positive versions of $n$-gram grammars and show that they are expressively equivalent.
Like in the section on the equivalence of mixed and fixed $n$-gram grammars, this is accomplished by a **constructive** proof.
A proof is constructive if it doesn't just derive the existence of some object, but gives a concrete procedure for constructing this object.
In the case at hand, the proof shows how to construct a positive grammar from a negative one, and the other way around.

\begin{definition}
Let $\Sigma$ be some alphabet, and $\Sigma_\$$ its extension with a distinguished edge marker symbol $\$$.
An $n$-gram over $\Sigma_\$$ is an element of $\Sigma_\$^n$ ($n \geq 1$).
An $n$-gram grammar $G$ over alphabet $\Sigma$ is a finite set of $n$-grams over $\Sigma_\$$.
Every $n$-gram grammar has a **polarity**:
<ol>
<li>
If $G$ is negative ($^-G$), then a string $s$ over $\Sigma$ is well-formed with respect to $^-G$ iff there are no $u, v$ over $\Sigma_\$$ and no $g \in ^-G$ such that
$ \$^{n-1} \stringcat s \stringcat \$^{n-1} = u \stringcat g \stringcat v$.
</li>
<li>
If $G$ is positive ($^+G$), then a string $s$ over $\Sigma$ is well-formed with respect to $^+G$ iff for all $u, v$ over $\Sigma_\$$ and $g \in \Sigma_\$^n$ such that $\$^{n-1} \stringcat s \stringcat \$^{n-1} = u \stringcat g \stringcat v$, it holds that $g \in ^+G$.
</ol>
The **language of $G$**, denoted $L(G)$, contains all strings that are well-formed with respect to $G$, and only those.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
For every $n$-gram grammar $G$ there exists a grammar $G'$ of opposite polarity such that $L(G) = L(G')$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We assume w.l.o.g. that $G$ is a positive grammar and denote it by $^+G$.
We define a negative counterpart $^-G'$ as $\Sigma_\$^n - ^+G$ and show that $L(^+G) = L(^-G')$.

<br>
First, every $s \in L(^+G)$ is also a member of $L(^-G')$.
Assume towards a contradiction that $s \notin L(^-G')$.
Then there must be some $g \in ^-G'$ such that $\$^{n-1} \stringcat s \stringcat \$^{n-1} = u \stringcat g \stringcat v$ ($u,v \in \Sigma_\$^*$).
But since $^-G' \is \Sigma_\$^n - ^+G$, it must hold that $g \notin ^+G$, wherefore $s \notin L(^+G)$.
As this contradicts our initial assumption that $s \in L(^+G)$, it cannot be the case that $s \notin L(^-G')$.
So $s \in L(^-G')$ after all.

<br>
In the other direction, suppose that $s \notin L(^+G)$.
Then by definition there are $u, v \in \Sigma_\$^*$ and $\Sigma_\$^n \ni g \notin ^+G$ such that $\$^{n-1} \stringcat s  \stringcat \$^{n-1} = u \stringcat g \stringcat v$.
But then $g \in ^-G'$, which entails $s \notin L(^-G')$.

<br>
This shows that $s \in L(^+G)$ iff $s \in L(^-G')$.
As $s$ was arbitrary, this holds for all strings and establishes $L(^+G) = L(^-G')$, which concludes our proof.
\end{proof}
