    "\n",
    "The graph-theoretic insights from the previous notebook can also be expressed in order theoretic terms.\n",
    "This part is somewhat technical, so you might have to read it multiple times to make sure you understand what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define an equivalence relation $\\sim$ such that $x \\sim y$ iff both $x \\leq y$ and $y \\leq x$ hold.\n",
    "In most of the linguistic hierarchies, there are no cases where $x \\sim y$ unless $x = y$.\n",
    "But in the noun stem allomorphy hierarchy, we have\n",
    "$\\text{Acc} \\sim \\text{Gen} \\sim \\text{Dat} \\sim \\text{others}$.\n",
    "Let $C$ be the set of all cases in this hierarchy, and $C/\\sim$ the corresponding quotient set under the equivalence relation $\\sim$.\n",
    "The quotient set consists of two equivalence classes, one containing only nominative and one containing all other cases.\n",
    "We define a special order $\\sqsubseteq$ on this structure such that $[x] \\sqsubseteq [y]$ iff $x \\leq y$ in the original hierarchy.\n",
    "So now we have a quotient structure that looks exactly like the lattice **2**, except that one element represents nominative and the other all other cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with the graph-theoretic approach in the previous notebook, we have taken the one instance of a hierarchy that is not a semilattice and have shown that it still forms a semilattice at a higher level of abstraction.\n",
    "The only difference to our previous strategy is that this level of abstraction is now defined in terms of quotient structures rather than graph condensations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can construct such quotient structures for all other hierarchies, but in these cases the two look exactly the same because there is a one-to-one relation between elements in the hierarchy and equivalence classes in the quotient structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Construct the quotient structure for the standard case hierarchy (in which accusative and genitive are unordered with respect to each other).\n",
    "Verify for yourself that the quotient structure has exactly the same shape as this hierarchy.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, then, we can formulate the following restriction on linguistic hierarchies: given $\\sim$ as defined above, every linguistic hierarchy must have a quotient structure under $\\sim$ that forms a semilattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "The first attempt at a person-person hierarchy for the PCC had the shape below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![mid](./pcc_hierarchy_wrong_reduced.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This hierarchy did not work as desired for the PCC, and we were forced to modify the ordering of person-person combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![mid](./pcc_hierarchy_right_reduced.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the latter is much less appealing than the former.\n",
    "But our new understanding of what linguistic hierarchies reveals that the former is not a licit hierarchy to begin with.\n",
    "Explain why!\n",
