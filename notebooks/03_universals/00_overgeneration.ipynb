    "# The problem of overgeneration\n",
    "\n",
    "In our discussion of $n$-gram models, we were largely concerned with specifying grammars for specific phenomena.\n",
    "Among other things, you wrote grammars for word-final devoicing, intervocalic voicing, and penultimate stress.\n",
    "This shows that many phenomena can be accounted for by very simple models.\n",
    "But there is a problem: the opposite also holds.\n",
    "This whole unit is dedicated to explaining what this means, why it is a problem, and how it can be addressed in at least some domains.\n",
    "The first two points are handled in this notebook, whereas the latter is spread out over the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overgeneration and undergeneration\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a major problem with $n$-gram models, in fact every computational model.\n",
    "All these models take for granted that there is a fixed alphabet, and the elements of these alphabet are treated as unanalyzable atoms without any additional properties.\n",
    "As far as an $n$-gram grammar is concerned, *s* and *f* do not differ in any relevant sense from *z* and *v*.\n",
    "So just like one can write a grammar for intervocalic voicing, one can also write one for intervocalic devoicing.\n",
    "But the former is a very natural process, whereas the latter has not been found in even a single language.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Write a negative grammar for intervocalic devoicing, assuming that the alphabet consists only of *a*, *i*, *u*, *s*, *z*, *f*, and *v*.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Assuming the same alphabet as before,\n",
    "write an $n$-gram grammar (it may be positive or negative) that requires every word to consist of exactly 5 symbols.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Assuming the same alphabet as before,\n",
    "write an $n$-gram grammar (it may be positive or negative) that requires every word to start with *a* and end with *f*.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Assuming the same alphabet as before,\n",
    "write an $n$-gram grammar (it may be positive or negative) for \"penultimate f\": if a word has at least two symbols, then the last but one symbol must be f and no other position may be f.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Suppose that English only contains the words *the*, *old*, *man*, *woman*, *sleep*, *sleeps*, *snore*, and *snores*.\n",
    "Assume furthermore that the English subject verb agreement system works as follows: if the subject does not contain an adjective (like *old*), then use the inflected verb form; otherwise, use the base form.\n",
    "So we would get *The old man snore* but *The man snores*.\n",
    "Write an $n$-gram grammar that captures this unnatural condition.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that our models **overgenerate** from a typological perspective as they can not only express constraints that occur in natural languages, but also phenomena that do not.\n",
    "Overgeneration is a better position to be in than **undergeneration**, when a formalism cannot capture all relevant phenomena.\n",
    "It's better to do too much than too little.\n",
    "Unfortunately, many formalisms suffer from both: not all phenomena can be handled, and the formalism can also express unnatural patterns (yes, $n$-gram models are in this unfortunate situation as we will learn in a later unit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, a formalism would provide a perfect fit for natural language, which means that it neither overgenerates nor undergenerates.\n",
    "No such formalism exists at the point of writing.\n",
    "There have been many attempts to design more expressive models that do not undergenerate.\n",
    "Overgeneration, on the other hand, has seen a lot less work.\n",
    "This is not ideal because the larger the range of phenomena that can be described, the harder it is to design a learning algorithm for the model.\n",
    "The intuition here is that you'll have a much easier time picking the right language among, say, 100 candidates rather than 1000.\n",
    "A learning algorithm that assumes that a natural language could display an unnatural process like intervocalic devoicing needs more data to rule out this hypothesis.\n",
    "Data isn't cheap, so overgeneration should be avoided if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Universals\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguists use the term **universals** to refer to the fact that natural languages do not vary in all logically conceivable ways.\n",
    "A process that can be described by an $n$-gram grammar may still never arise because it violates certain universals.\n",
    "The idea of universals is very powerful: if we can identify a reliable list of universals, then we have a very good idea of what our models have to be capable of and what is superfluous.\n",
    "This would allow us to design more restrictive and efficient models that can be learned from less data.\n",
    "Unfortunately we do not have such a list yet, and this is one of the reasons why computer models still do much worse than humans in several respects.\n",
    "In particular, children learn their native language effortlessly with relatively little input, whereas current machine learning models need huge amounts of data.\n",
    "And children will never try to do anything like intervocalic devoicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguists distinguish two types of universals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Formal universals**  \n",
    "    These identify abstract properties of the \"grammar machine\".\n",
    "    For example, if all linguistic phenomena could be described by $n$-gram grammars (they can't, unfortunately), that would be a formal universal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Substantive universals**  \n",
    "    These identify properties of the \"building material\" used by the grammar machine.\n",
    "    A substantive universal might explain, for example, why intervocalic voicing is common and intervocalic devoicing unattested even though both could be produced by the grammar machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next notebook discusses some mathematical properties that might be substantive universals."
